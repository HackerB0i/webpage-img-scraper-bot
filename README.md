# webpage-img-scraper
Fork of NorthernChicken's scraper script.

The features of the regular working script has been implemented into a basic discord bot that sends the scraped images in a Discord channel.

A lot of images on websites (icons, buttons, and the like) cannot be processed. Best use is for raw image galleries like on wikipedia commons and stuff like that.
