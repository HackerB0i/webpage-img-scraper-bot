# webpage-img-scraper
Scrapes the images from a webpage from a URL.

Still under development. Don't expect it to work.

The main script `scraper.py` should work for some websites, but for sites that use JavaScript for loading images Selenium must be used. The Selenium script does not work as of yet.
